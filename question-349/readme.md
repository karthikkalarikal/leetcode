# Intersection Of Two Arrays

## Problem Description

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be __unique__ and you may return the result in __any order__.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n*m)
  - The algorithm utilizes a binary search approach, efficiently reducing the search space in each iteration.

- **Space Complexity:** O(min(n, m))
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the size of the input array. The space required is independent of the array size.
