# Intersection Of Two Arrays

## Problem Description

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be __unique__ and you may return the result in __any order__.

- **Time Complexity:** O(n*m)
  - This algorithm uses brute force method.

- **Space Complexity:** O(min(n, m))
  - The algorithm need a map and slice to store the values.
