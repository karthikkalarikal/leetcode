## How to Run Tests  

To ensure the correctness of the algorithms, you can run the included tests. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the specific algorithm's directory, e.g., [Next Greatest Letter](./question-744).

2. Open a terminal in that directory.

3. Run the tests using the following command:
   ```bash
   go test
