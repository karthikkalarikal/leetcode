## Table of Contents
- [Next Greatest Letter](./question-744) - Find the smallest character in a sorted array greater than a given target.
- [Arrange Coins](./question-441) - Determine the number of complete rows that can be formed with a given number of coins.
- [Is Perfect Square](./question-367) - Check if a given positive integer is a perfect square.

## How to Run Tests

To ensure the correctness of the algorithms, you can run the included tests. Follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the specific algorithm's directory, e.g., [Next Greatest Letter](./question-744).

2. Open a terminal in that directory.

3. Run the tests using the following command:
   ```bash
   go test
